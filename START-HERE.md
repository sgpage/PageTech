## 💡 How It Works

### When a User Reports a Fault:

1. **User fills out form** on reportfault.html
   - Device info captured automatically
   - Screenshots uploaded or URLs provided
   
2. **Form submits to Netlify Function** (submit-fault-report.js)
   - Validates required fields
   - Formats data for GitHub
   
3. **GitHub Issue Created**
   - Titled: "[Fault Report] CRITICAL: App crashes..."
   - Contains all details, device info, images
   - Labeled: bug, user-reported, priority-critical
   
4. **Email Sent to You**
   - Beautiful HTML email
   - Direct link to GitHub issue
   - Key details highlighted
   - Sent to steve@pagetech.com
   
5. **User Sees Success**
   - Confirmation message
   - Link to their GitHub issue
   - Can track progress

## 🎯 What You Can Do With Your App

### Pre-fill Fault Reports from DetectLogPro

Your app can create deep links to pre-fill fault data:

```
https://yoursite.com/reportfault.html?finds=150&images=url1,url2&fault=App%20crashed
```

Parameters:
- `finds` - Number of finds in database
- `images` - Comma-separated image URLs
- `fault` - Pre-filled fault description

Example from Swift (iOS):
```swift
let finds = userDatabase.count
let imageUrls = uploadedImages.map { $0.url }.joined(separator: ",")
let fault = "App crashed when viewing statistics"

let url = "https://pagetech.com/reportfault.html?finds=\(finds)&images=\(imageUrls)&fault=\(fault.addingPercentEncoding()!)"

UIApplication.shared.open(URL(string: url)!)
```
